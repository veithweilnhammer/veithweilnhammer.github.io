I am a neuroscientist, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist. I work on digital technologies to better understand, predict, and improve mental health.

I am particularly interested in how humans make sense of ambiguous situations: How do people extract meaning from noisy data? How do they apply what they’ve learned to new but uncertain contexts? And what behavioral strategies help them avoid falling into self-fulfilling prophecies – for instance, seeing what they expect rather than what is actually there?
