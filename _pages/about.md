I am a neuroscientist, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist. I work on digital technologies to better understand, predict, and improve mental health.

My research focuses on how the brain balances exploration and exploitation â€” whether to rely on prior knowledge or update our beliefs in light of new information. This balance is essential for perception, decision-making, and mental health. To study this, I apply computational models to games and virtual environments where humans and machines interact. These tools help us understand how we build internal models of the world, when they go off track, and how that can lead to altered experiences of reality.
