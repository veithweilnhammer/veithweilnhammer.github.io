It involves a continuous tradeoff between <strong>exploration</strong> — sampling new sensory information — and <strong>exploitation</strong>—relying on prior knowledge and expectations. Our research shows that the brain actively alternates between two functional modes: an <strong>external mode</strong>, where behavior is driven by sensory inputs, and an <strong>internal mode</strong>, where perceptual and cognitive processes are shaped by internal predictions and memory.</p> <p>These fluctuations reflect a fundamental cognitive strategy: switching between information-seeking and belief-based inference. Crucially, we show that this dynamic balance can break down in psychotic states, offering a mechanistic explanation for hallucinations and delusions.</p> <h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2> <h3 id="dynamic-explore-exploit-fluctuations">Dynamic Explore-Exploit Fluctuations</h3> <p>Analyzing behavioral data from large-scale experiments, we found that perception fluctuates rhythmically between an <strong>external, exploratory mode</strong> (high accuracy, driven by current input) and an <strong>internal, exploitative mode</strong> (strong reliance on perceptual history). These dynamics help balance sensitivity to novelty with the stability of interpretation.</p> <h3 id="internal-predictions-and-false-percepts">Internal Predictions and False Percepts</h3> <p>In internal mode, the brain relies on <strong>predictive templates</strong>, which can lead to misperceptions or <strong>false alarms</strong> — a hallmark of hallucinations. Computational modeling using GLM-HMM shows that these templates fluctuate spontaneously and are amplified in individuals with psychosis-proneness.</p> <h3 id="nmdar-hypofunction-disrupts-the-balance">NMDAR Hypofunction Disrupts the Balance</h3> <p>Pharmacological manipulation with <strong>S-ketamine</strong>, which blocks NMDA receptors, shifts the brain into a prolonged internal (exploitative) mode, disrupting adaptive switching. This mimics perceptual disturbances seen in schizophrenia and demonstrates a causal link between neurotransmission, cognitive mode dynamics, and psychotic symptoms.</p> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <p>We used an integrated approach across multiple domains:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Behavior experiments</strong> to induce competition between internal and external interpretations.</li> <li><strong>GLM-HMM</strong> models to infer latent mode dynamics from behavior.</li> <li><strong>S-ketamine experiments</strong> to simulate NMDA receptor hypofunction.</li> <li><strong>Clinical comparisons</strong> between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.</li> </ul> <h2 id="implications">Implications</h2> <p>Our findings suggest that the <strong>explore-exploit balance in perception</strong> is a core computational principle—and a potential <strong>biomarker</strong> for psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. Stabilizing these dynamics could form the basis for targeted therapies aimed at restoring cognitive flexibility and perceptual accuracy.</p> <h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2> <ul> <li>Real-time monitoring of explore-exploit mode dynamics as a diagnostic tool.</li> <li>Closed-loop interventions to support flexible perceptual inference.</li> <li>Expanding the framework to domains like memory recall, belief formation, and social cognition.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/assets/reveal/modes_Basel_2.html">Interactive Demo: Internal and External Modes</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Veith Weilnhammer</name></author><category term="explore-exploit"/><category term="perception"/><category term="cognition"/><category term="hallucinations"/><category term="ketamine"/><category term="GLM-HMM"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perception and cognition alternate between external sampling and internal prediction.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why We Need Real-Time Authentication That You Can Share</title><link href="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/human_auth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why We Need Real-Time Authentication That You Can Share"/><published>2024-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/human_auth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/human_auth/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>With online interactions becoming increasingly instantaneous, distinguishing humans from machines has become surprisingly difficult. Traditional CAPTCHAs, like selecting traffic lights or distorted text, are outdated, interruptive, and unsuitable for real-time engagement. At Pixelblot, we’re developing a new approach to human authentication: a real-time, effortless, and sharable proof-of-humanity.</p> <h2 id="limitations-of-current-solutions">Limitations of Current Solutions</h2> <p>Existing solutions often run invisibly in the background, verifying users before granting access to a service. But once they’re inside, real-time interactions, such as chatting, gaming, or collaborative work, still lack ongoing human verification. User can’t share invisible CAPTCHAs, which limits their effectiveness in establishing trust and transparency among people. Traditional verification systems are designed as barriers rather than tools for continuous authentication, leading to frustration and low user engagement.</p> <h2 id="real-time-interaction">Real-Time Interaction</h2> <p>In the digital world, interactions often occur instantly — like messaging, social media posts, or online gaming. This immediacy requires human authentication that’s works in real-time. This is particularly true today, as AI agents increasingly mimic human-like interactions convincingly. At Pixelblot, we’re addressing this gap by developing an innovative authentication solution that verifies users rapidly, within seconds, ensuring real-time interactions remain genuine and frictionless.</p> <h2 id="shareability-and-trust">Shareability and Trust</h2> <p>What sets our approach apart is its shareability. Unlike traditional verification systems, our authentication provides a unique, shareable proof-of-humanity badge, the Pixelblot. Users can display this publicly, which increases transparency, trust, and community engagement. Imagine easily verifying yourself on social media, forums, or dating apps with a quick, recognizable badge proving you’re genuinely human. Generating your proof-of-humanity badge takes only 5 seconds. We never know who you are, just that you are human, and you don’t need to create an account.</p> <h2 id="practical-use-cases">Practical Use Cases</h2> <p>Here are some scenarios where instant, shareable authentication transforms online experiences:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Quickly authenticate real users, reducing spam, bots, and misinformation.</li> <li><strong>Online Gaming:</strong> Genuine player interactions, ensuring fair play and community trust.</li> <li><strong>Dating Platforms:</strong> Boost authenticity and safety with immediate human verification.</li> <li><strong>Online Communities:</strong> Strengthen forums and discussion groups by guaranteeing real user participation.</li> <li><strong>Sensitive Interactions:</strong> Verify humans in financial transactions, telehealth, or private data exchanges.</li> </ul> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>We envision a future where verifying human identity is seamless, transparent, and deeply integrated into our digital lives. The real-time, neuroscience-inspired authentication technology we’re developing at Pixelblot aims to make online interactions trustworthy, secure, and effortlessly authentic.</p>]]></content><author><name>Veith Weilnhammer</name></author><category term="authentication"/><category term="AI"/><category term="human verification"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rethinking human verification in the age of instant interactions and generative AI.]]></summary></entry></feed>
