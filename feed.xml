Our research explores how the brain adjust the balance between getting new information and knowledge. We found that, in perception and planning, people alternate between two modes: an <strong>external mode</strong>, where perception and cognitin are driven by external sensory information, and an <strong>internal mode</strong>, where perception and cognition are guided by prior knowledge. Our results suggest that psychotic experiences, like hallucinations and delusions, may be related to an imbalance between external and internal modes.</p> <h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2> <h3 id="internal-vs-external-modes">Internal vs External Modes</h3> <p>Using large-scale behavioral data, we demonstrated systematic fluctuations in perception between an external mode (high accuracy, minimal reliance on previous experiences) and an internal mode (strongly biased by perceptual history)[^1]. These fluctuations balanced novelty detection and stability.</p> <h3 id="predictive-templates--hallucinations">Predictive Templates &amp; Hallucinations</h3> <p>False perceptions (“false alarms”) arise from internal predictions (“predictive templates”), especially during internal mode[^2]. Computational modeling (HMM-GLM) revealed these templates fluctuate dynamically and linked them to the mechanisms underlying hallucinations.</p> <h3 id="nmdar-dysfunction--psychosis">NMDAR Dysfunction &amp; Psychosis</h3> <p>We showed that pharmacologically-induced NMDAR hypofunction (using S-ketamine) prolongs external mode dominance, causing erratic perceptual inferences. This mirrors key aspects of perceptual disruptions seen in schizophrenia and offers a mechanistic explanation for episodic psychotic symptoms[^3].</p> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <p>We combined multiple complementary methodologies:</p> <ul> <li>Behavioral experiments using ambiguous visual stimuli.</li> <li>Computational models (Hidden Markov and General Linear Models, GLM-HMM) to quantify perceptual mode dynamics.</li> <li>Pharmacological experiments with S-ketamine.</li> <li>Clinical studies comparing schizophrenia patients with controls.</li> </ul> <h2 id="implications">Implications</h2> <p>Clarifying these perceptual dynamics offers important implications for psychiatric care. Dynamic perceptual mode shifts might serve as biomarkers for psychosis, informing novel neuromodulatory treatments targeting NMDAR function and perceptual stability.</p> <h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2> <ul> <li>Developing real-time monitoring of perceptual mode shifts as predictive tools for psychosis.</li> <li>Exploring closed-loop neuromodulation techniques to stabilize perceptual inference.</li> <li>Extending our computational framework to related cognitive domains, such as memory and decision-making.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/assets/reveal/modes_Basel_2.html">External and Internal Modes in Perception</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Veith Weilnhammer</name></author><category term="schizophrenia"/><category term="psychosis"/><category term="hallucinations"/><category term="ketamine"/><category term="HMM-GLM"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[External and internal modes of inference.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why We Need Real-Time Authentication That You Can Share</title><link href="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/human_auth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why We Need Real-Time Authentication That You Can Share"/><published>2024-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/human_auth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/human_auth/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>With online interactions becoming increasingly instantaneous, distinguishing humans from machines has become surprisingly difficult. Traditional CAPTCHAs, like selecting traffic lights or distorted text, are outdated, interruptive, and unsuitable for real-time engagement. At Pixelblot, we’re developing a new approach to human authentication: a real-time, effortless, and sharable proof-of-humanity.</p> <h2 id="limitations-of-current-solutions">Limitations of Current Solutions</h2> <p>Existing solutions often run invisibly in the background, verifying users before granting access to a service. But once they’re inside, real-time interactions, such as chatting, gaming, or collaborative work, still lack ongoing human verification. User can’t share invisible CAPTCHAs, which limits their effectiveness in establishing trust and transparency among people. Traditional verification systems are designed as barriers rather than tools for continuous authentication, leading to frustration and low user engagement.</p> <h2 id="real-time-interaction">Real-Time Interaction</h2> <p>In the digital world, interactions often occur instantly — like messaging, social media posts, or online gaming. This immediacy requires human authentication that’s works in real-time. This is particularly true today, as AI agents increasingly mimic human-like interactions convincingly. At Pixelblot, we’re addressing this gap by developing an innovative authentication solution that verifies users rapidly, within seconds, ensuring real-time interactions remain genuine and frictionless.</p> <h2 id="shareability-and-trust">Shareability and Trust</h2> <p>What sets our approach apart is its shareability. Unlike traditional verification systems, our authentication provides a unique, shareable proof-of-humanity badge, the Pixelblot. Users can display this publicly, which increases transparency, trust, and community engagement. Imagine easily verifying yourself on social media, forums, or dating apps with a quick, recognizable badge proving you’re genuinely human. Generating your proof-of-humanity badge takes only 5 seconds. We never know who you are, just that you are human, and you don’t need to create an account.</p> <h2 id="practical-use-cases">Practical Use Cases</h2> <p>Here are some scenarios where instant, shareable authentication transforms online experiences:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Quickly authenticate real users, reducing spam, bots, and misinformation.</li> <li><strong>Online Gaming:</strong> Genuine player interactions, ensuring fair play and community trust.</li> <li><strong>Dating Platforms:</strong> Boost authenticity and safety with immediate human verification.</li> <li><strong>Online Communities:</strong> Strengthen forums and discussion groups by guaranteeing real user participation.</li> <li><strong>Sensitive Interactions:</strong> Verify humans in financial transactions, telehealth, or private data exchanges.</li> </ul> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>We envision a future where verifying human identity is seamless, transparent, and deeply integrated into our digital lives. The real-time, neuroscience-inspired authentication technology we’re developing at Pixelblot aims to make online interactions trustworthy, secure, and effortlessly authentic.</p>]]></content><author><name>Veith Weilnhammer</name></author><category term="authentication"/><category term="AI"/><category term="human verification"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rethinking human verification in the age of instant interactions and generative AI.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What are the mechanisms that construct our experience of reality?</title><link href="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/consciousness/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What are the mechanisms that construct our experience of reality?"/><published>2024-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/consciousness</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/blog/consciousness/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>Have you ever wondered how your brain makes sense of the world around you? Sensory information is often noisy, incomplete, and ambiguous. Yet, our brains usually construct a coherent experience of reality. My research investigates how specific brain regions — particularly the <strong>inferior frontal cortex (IFC)</strong> and the <strong>anterior insula</strong> — help resolve in perception and beyond.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2> <h3 id="the-ifc-resolves-perceptual-ambiguity">The IFC Resolves Perceptual Ambiguity</h3> <p>Our experiments show that the IFC plays a crucial role in managing conflicting sensory signals. When we temporarily disrupted IFC activity using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), participants experienced slower perceptual shifts in tasks where visual stimuli could be interpreted in multiple ways. This finding suggests the IFC is actively involved in updating our conscious perception when faced with ambiguity.</p> <h3 id="the-insula-detects-unexpected-changes">The Insula Detects Unexpected Changes</h3> <p>Another key region, the anterior insula, along with the IFC, responds strongly to unexpected changes in both spatial and temporal contexts. These findings indicate that the insula helps detect moments when our predictions about the world fail, prompting the brain to adjust and update its expectations.</p> <h3 id="damage-to-ifc-reduces-perceptual-flexibility">Damage to IFC Reduces Perceptual Flexibility</h3> <p>In individuals who suffered strokes affecting the IFC, we found a significant reduction in their ability to spontaneously shift perceptions during ambiguous visual tasks. This supports the idea that a healthy IFC is essential for maintaining rgw flexibility in perception, ensuring our conscious experience remains dynamic and responsive.</p> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <p>To arrive at these conclusions, we used a diverse set of approaches:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Behavioral experiments</strong> using ambiguous visual stimuli.</li> <li><strong>Functional MRI (fMRI)</strong> to observe brain activity related to prediction errors.</li> <li><strong>Brain stimulation (TMS)</strong> to demonstrate causal relationships between IFC activity and perceptual updating.</li> <li><strong>Lesion studies</strong> in stroke patients with localized damage to IFC.</li> </ul> <h2 id="implications">Implications</h2> <p>Our findings provide valuable insights into how higher-order brain regions shape our perception. This research supports theories of predictive processing, which suggest that the brain continuously generates and updates internal predictions to interpret sensory information. The IFC, identified as a critical node in this network, could also be a promising target for therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing perceptual and cognitive disorders involving rigid or unstable perceptions.</p> <h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2> <p>Looking ahead, we plan to:</p> <ul> <li>Develop real-time methods to track prediction errors and perceptual updates.</li> <li>Explore targeted brain stimulation techniques to enhance or restore perceptual flexibility.</li> <li>Extend our research framework to other cognitive functions such as memory recall and belief updating.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/assets/reveal/CCN.html">Is the IFC part of the NCC?</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Veith Weilnhammer</name></author><category term="consciousness"/><category term="perception"/><category term="inference"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The role of frontoparietal networks in resolving sensory ambiguity.]]></summary></entry></feed>
