	•	I’m Veith, psychiatrist and neuroscientist, and co-founder of Pixelblot.
	•	At Pixelblot, we’ve built a portable proof-of-humanness: a lightweight, real-time token users can share online — without compromising their privacy.

📊 Slide – AI Agents & Bots

Main Message:
The way we interact online is shifting. Trust hasn’t caught up.

Talking Points:
	•	AI agents are quickly becoming the new default interface — not apps, not websites. This shift has been publicly acknowledged by leaders like Satya Nadella.
	•	But while AI gets smarter, bots get better — and almost half of all internet traffic is now bot-generated. (Source: Imperva 2024)
	•	This puts pressure on platforms to find new ways to verify who’s real — and to do it without slowing users down or violating privacy.

📈 Slide – Market Opportunity

Main Message:
The need for scalable, private, real-time trust is massive.

Chart Summary:
	•	This slide shows the Total Available Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) across 5 verticals.
	•	The biggest opportunity lies in P2P verification, worth nearly $1.9B TAM — think peer messaging, signing, and exchanges.
	•	Even niche segments like Sybil resistance in Web3 have a growing, addressable value.
	•	Pixelblot touches all of these.

📈 Slide – GTM & Revenue Strategy

Main Message:
We have a clear plan for usage and revenue growth.

Talking Points (Left - Revenue Strategy):

	•	Free tier → engagement + visibility
	•	API tokens → monetization per human proof
	•	Platform integrations → large-scale revenue

Talking Points (Right - Projections):
	•	We’re starting with ~100 DAU now, and growing toward 50,000 DAU by 2027.
	•	Revenue projections:
	•	$100k ARR by end of 2025
	•	$3M ARR by early 2027
	•	Our architecture and pricing scale with volume — so it’s lean early and lucrative late.

🟢 MARKET TERMS

	•	For example, limited by geography, tech stack, or regulatory scope.

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
