## Overview

Perception requires the brain to continually balance incoming sensory signals with internal predictions. Our research explores how perception dynamically fluctuates between two distinct modes: an **external mode**, dominated by immediate sensory inputs, and an **internal mode**, shaped by prior expectations and experiences. These perceptual modes are particularly relevant in understanding conditions like schizophrenia, where disruptions in sensory integration can lead to psychosis and hallucinations.

## Background

Predictive processing theories propose that psychosis results from impaired integration between sensory information and internal predictive models. Central to this integration is the **N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)**, a receptor consistently implicated in schizophrenia. We investigated whether perceptual symptoms in psychosis might emerge from dynamic shifts between external and internal perceptual modes, driven by disruptions in NMDAR functioning.

## Key Findings Across Studies

### 1. Human and animal perception cycles between internal and external modes (PLOS Biology, Weilnhammer et al., 2023)

Using large-scale datasets from humans and mice, we found systematic fluctuations in perception between external mode (high sensory accuracy, minimal bias) and internal mode (strong reliance on prior experiences, high bias). Computational models (GLM-HMMs) revealed these fluctuations are not random, but reflect a structured mechanism that balances sensory novelty and perceptual stability.

### 2. Predictive templates drive false perceptions (Current Biology, Weilnhammer et al., 2024)

False alarms—perceiving signals in the absence of actual sensory input—offer insights into hallucinatory experiences. We found that false alarms arise from dynamically fluctuating internal predictions ("predictive templates") shaped by recent perceptual history. These templates dominate during internal perceptual modes, increasing vulnerability to hallucinations.

### 3. NMDAR dysfunction disrupts perceptual mode balance (Brain, Weilnhammer et al., 2024)

Pharmacologically induced NMDAR hypofunction (via S-ketamine) and schizophrenia both resulted in prolonged external perceptual modes. This heightened sensory-driven perception causes transient disconnects from stable internal predictive models, providing a neurocomputational explanation for episodic psychotic symptoms.

## Synthesis

Together, our findings illustrate how dynamic shifts between external and internal perceptual modes influence psychotic experiences. An overly dominant external mode leads to unstable sensory interpretations under ambiguous conditions. In turn, this instability shapes maladaptive predictive templates, causing psychotic experiences when internal mode prevails. Understanding these dynamics opens avenues for interventions aimed at stabilizing perception in schizophrenia.

## Approach and Methodology

We employed a multi-method approach:

- Behavioral psychophysics with ambiguous sensory stimuli (structure-from-motion, noise paradigms).
- Computational modeling (HMM-GLM) to quantify and explain perceptual mode dynamics.
- Pharmacological studies using S-ketamine to model NMDAR hypofunction.
- Clinical comparisons between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

## Relevance and Clinical Implications

Our work deepens the understanding of perceptual inference deficits underlying psychosis. By clarifying how dynamic perceptual fluctuations relate to NMDAR dysfunction, we identify potential biomarkers for psychosis risk and highlight new targets for therapeutic interventions, such as closed-loop neuromodulation to stabilize perceptual modes.

## Future Directions

Our findings open promising paths forward:

- **Real-time perceptual tracking:** Developing continuous methods to track perceptual mode shifts for early psychosis detection.
- **Neuromodulation therapies:** Exploring brain stimulation and pharmacological interventions to stabilize perceptual inference and reduce psychotic symptoms.
- **Extension to cognition:** Applying this computational framework to memory, decision-making, and other cognitive functions impaired in psychosis.
