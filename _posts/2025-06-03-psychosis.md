## Overview

This seminar explores psychotic experiences and schizophrenia. It combines real-world narratives, clinical tools, and scientific models to promote understanding and effective care strategies. Participants will learn to identify red flags, communicate compassionately, and support recovery in individuals experiencing psychosis.

## Psychosis: Definition & Types

- **Psychotic experiences**: Disruptions in perception, cognition, and reality monitoring.
- **Core phenomena**:
  - Hallucinations
  - Delusions
  - Disorganized speech or behavior
  - Thought insertion and passivity experiences
- **Associated disorders**: Schizophrenia spectrum, mood disorders with psychotic features, substance-induced psychosis

---

## Diagnosis & Classification

- **DSM-5 Criteria for Schizophrenia**:
  - Two or more core symptoms for at least one month
  - Functional impairment and chronicity (6+ months total)
- **ICD-10 vs ICD-11**:
  - ICD-11 eliminates subtypes
  - New symptom specifiers and clearer course patterns
- **Syndrome vs. diagnosis**: Psychosis is a transdiagnostic state, not a single disease

---

## Course & Epidemiology

- Onset: Adolescence to early adulthood (earlier in males)
- Prevalence: ~0.5% globally
- Course:
  - Prodrome ‚Üí first episode ‚Üí variable outcomes
  - Recovery, relapse, or chronic course
- Better prognosis with early detection, support, and treatment

---

## Causes & Risk Factors

- **Biopsychosocial framework**:
  - **Genetic**: Family history increases risk
  - **Environmental**: Trauma, urbanicity, substance use (esp. cannabis)
  - **Neurodevelopmental**: Obstetric complications
  - **Models**:
    - Diathesis-stress
    - Predictive coding failures
    - Neurodevelopmental cascade
    - Cognitive misattribution theories

---

## Detection & Assessment

- **Red flags**:
  - Social withdrawal, odd beliefs, suspiciousness, functional decline
- **Tools**:
  - Structured interviews (e.g. PANSS, CAPS, PDI, BPRS)
- **Clinical assessment**:
  - Emphasis on insight, affect, and reality testing
  - Early digital screening tools show promise

---

## Communication Strategies

- **Principles**:
  - Validate emotions, not delusions
  - Maintain calm, non-confrontational stance
  - Respect autonomy and foster collaboration
- **Digital care**:
  - Extra focus on tone, predictability, grounding
  - Document risk carefully

---

## Evidence-Based Treatments

- **Multimodal care**:
  - Antipsychotic medication
  - CBT for psychosis (CBTp)
  - Family interventions
  - Supported employment and housing
- **Recovery framework**:
  - Hope, empowerment, shared decision-making
  - Seamless transitions and outpatient integration
  - Peer support and case management

---

## Case Studies

- **The Suspicious Neighbor**: Early paranoia, responsive to early intervention
- **Voices on the Line**: Acute psychosis during crisis, role of decompensation
- **The Impostor Family**: Delusional misidentification linked to trauma
- **The Silent Withdrawal**: Gradual disengagement, missed early signs

## Summary & Reflections

- Psychosis reflects breakdowns in perception and cognition
- Effective detection and care require curiosity, compassion, and coordination
- Integrating biological and lived perspectives is key to reducing stigma and supporting healing
