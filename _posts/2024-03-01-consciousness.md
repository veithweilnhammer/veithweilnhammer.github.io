## Overview

Conscious perception is a complex cognitive process involving continuous integration and interpretation of ambiguous sensory inputs. Our work examines how frontoparietal brain regions ‚Äî particularly the **inferior frontal cortex (IFC)** and **anterior insula** ‚Äî detect and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Using human neuroimaging, computational modeling, clinical lesion studies, and non-invasive brain stimulation, we have explored how these regions dynamically manage sensory conflicts to maintain coherent and stable conscious experience.

## Background

Perception inherently involves uncertainty, requiring the brain to constantly resolve ambiguous inputs. Bistable perception exemplifies this process, as observers experience spontaneous alternations between two mutually exclusive perceptual states despite unchanging sensory input. 

Predictive processing theories propose that perception involves continuous interaction between incoming sensory signals and internal predictive models. When predictions conflict with sensory input, prediction errors are thought to occur and lead up to changes in perception. Our research examines the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this dynamic resolution of perceptual conflicts, focusing on the role of frontoparietal regions ‚Äî primarily the inferior frontal cortex and anterior insula.

## Key Findings Across Studies

### 1. Inferior Frontal Cortex resolves perceptual ambiguities (Current Biology, Weilnhammer et al., 2021)

Our combined fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies showed that the inferior frontal cortex actively detects perceptual conflicts in bistable perception tasks. Crucially, transient disruption of IFC activity through TMS slowed perceptual updates, demonstrating IFC‚Äôs causal role in resolving sensory ambiguity and shaping conscious perception.

### 2. Anterior Insula detects generalized perceptual conflicts (bioRxiv, Reichenbach et al., 2024)

We investigated whether frontoparietal conflict detection generalizes beyond temporal context (past perceptual experiences) to include spatial context (surrounding perceptual environment). We found that perceptual conflicts that conflicts with spatial and temporal contexts activated common neural substrates, prominently the bilateral anterior insula and right inferior frontal cortex. This suggests a generalized predictive-processing mechanism within frontoparietal regions for resolving various forms of perceptual ambiguity.

### 3. Structural lesions confirm IFC's role in conscious perception (bioRxiv, Fritsch et al., 2024)

Extending our approach to structural lesions, we examined patients with ischemic strokes affecting the IFC. Compared to stroke patients without IFC lesions, those with IFC lesions showed fewer spontaneous perceptual switches when viewing ambiguous visual stimuli. This finding strongly reinforces the causal role of IFC in mediating dynamic perceptual updates and conscious visual experience.

## Synthesis

Together, these studies highlight a cohesive neurocomputational framework for conscious perception, emphasizing the active role of frontoparietal regions ‚Äî especially the inferior frontal cortex and anterior insula ‚Äî in detecting and resolving sensory ambiguity. The inferior frontal cortex specifically emerges as critical for transforming ambiguous sensory information into stable conscious experiences.

## Approach and Methodology

We employed a multidisciplinary methodology integrating:

- Behavioral psychophysics and bistable perception paradigms to measure perceptual states and transitions in human participants.
- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) combined with computational modeling to identify neural correlates of perceptual conflict.
- Clinical lesion studies comparing patients with selective IFC damage against control patients, assessing the causal impact of IFC dysfunction on perception.
- Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques (TMS) to establish causal links between IFC activity and perceptual conflict resolution mechanisms.

## Relevance and Clinical Implications

Our findings refine the predictive processing framework by clarifying the precise neurocomputational roles of frontal and insular regions in perceptual inference. By highlighting IFC‚Äôs role in resolving perceptual conflicts, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the neural bases of consciousness and has significant clinical relevance. Frontoparietal mechanisms for conflict resolution could represent novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets in disorders characterized by perceptual instability, such as schizophrenia, offering opportunities for innovative neuromodulatory interventions to stabilize conscious perception.

## Future Directions

Building on these insights, future research will explore:

- **Real-time neural monitoring:** Developing methods to continuously track perceptual mode fluctuations and IFC activation, aiming at predicting and managing psychotic episodes.
- **Broader cognitive applications:** Extending the investigation to related cognitive domains, such as memory and decision-making, to comprehensively map the influence of IFC-mediated conflict resolution across various cognitive processes.
- **Clinical neuromodulation:** Testing closed-loop neuromodulation approaches targeting IFC and related frontoparietal regions to therapeutically stabilize disrupted perception in clinical populations.
