## Overview

Have you ever wondered how your brain makes sense of the world around you? Sensory information is often noisy, incomplete, and ambiguous. Yet, our brains usually construct a coherent experience of reality. My research investigates how specific brain regions — particularly the **inferior frontal cortex (IFC)** and the **anterior insula** — help resolve ambiguity in perception and beyond.

## Key Findings

### 1. The IFC Resolves Perceptual Ambiguity

Our experiments show that the IFC plays a crucial role in managing conflicting sensory signals. When we temporarily disrupted IFC activity using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), participants experienced slower perceptual shifts in tasks where visual stimuli could be interpreted in multiple ways. This finding suggests the IFC is actively involved in updating our conscious perception when faced with ambiguity.

### 2. The Insula Detects Unexpected Changes

Another key region, the anterior insula, along with the IFC, responds strongly to unexpected changes in both spatial and temporal contexts. These findings indicate that the insula helps detect moments when our predictions about the world fail, prompting the brain to adjust and update its expectations.

### 3. Damage to IFC Reduces Perceptual Flexibility

In individuals who suffered strokes affecting the IFC, we found a significant reduction in their ability to spontaneously shift perceptions during ambiguous visual tasks. This supports the idea that a healthy IFC is essential for maintaining the flexibility in perception, ensuring our conscious experience remains dynamic and responsive.

## Methods

To arrive at these conclusions, we used a diverse set of approaches:

- **Behavioral experiments** using ambiguous visual stimuli.
- **Functional MRI (fMRI)** to observe brain activity related to prediction errors.
- **Brain stimulation (TMS)** to demonstrate causal relationships between IFC activity and perceptual updating.
- **Lesion studies** in stroke patients with localized damage to IFC.

## Implications

Our findings provide valuable insights into how higher-order brain regions shape our perception. This research supports theories of predictive processing, which suggest that the brain continuously generates and updates internal predictions to interpret sensory information. The IFC, identified as a critical node in this network, could also be a promising target for therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing perceptual and cognitive disorders involving rigid or unstable perceptions.

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, we plan to:

- Develop real-time methods to track prediction errors and perceptual updates.
- Explore targeted brain stimulation techniques to enhance or restore perceptual flexibility.
- Extend our research framework to other cognitive functions such as memory recall and belief updating.
