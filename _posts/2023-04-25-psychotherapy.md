# Welcome to My Psychotherapy Practice

Hello and thank you for visiting my website! I’m a **psychiatrist**, **psychotherapist**, and **neuroscientist**, offering a blend of evidence-based treatments in a supportive setting. My goal is to help you navigate life’s challenges, develop resilience, and achieve genuine well-being.

## My Therapeutic Approach

I believe in a **holistic approach** to mental health, combining multiple modalities to best serve each client. Here are some key principles and methods I draw upon:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Work on practical strategies to reframe unhelpful thinking patterns.  
- **Systemic Psychotherapy**: Understand the interplay between individual behaviors and wider social or family dynamics.  
- **Mindfulness and Acceptance Techniques**: Develop awareness, resilience, and compassion for oneself.  
- **Evidence-Based Medicine**: Use research-backed interventions that align with modern psychiatric and neuroscientific findings.  

I’ve previously worked in inpatient and outpatient settings, and have a special interest in **schizophrenia**, **mood disorders**, and **stress-related conditions**. I also offer **ketamine- and TMS-assisted treatments** under specific circumstances and settings, as well as digital mental health tools to monitor and improve mental well-being.
